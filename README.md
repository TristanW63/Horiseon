# Code Refactor Starter Code
# I went through the html and css code and fixed a few links that way when clicked it would take you to the portion of the page.
# I went into the html code and condensed the div classes to make it easier to read and load faster.
# The css code had alot of repeat classes, i went through and condensed them into 4 classes instead of 12.
